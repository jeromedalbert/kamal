# Aliases
#
# Aliases are shortcuts for Kamal commands.
#
# For example, for a Rails app, you might open a console with:
#
# ```shell
# kamal app exec -i -r console "rails console"
# ```
#
# By defining an alias, like this:
aliases:
  console:
    command: app exec
    arguments: rails console
    options:
      role: console
      interactive: true
# You can now open the console with:
# ```shell
# kamal console
# ```

# Configuring aliases
#
# Aliases are defined in the root config under the alias key
#
# Each alias is named and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.

aliases:
  uname:

    # Command
    #
    # This is the command to run, for subcommands use a space separated string
    command: app exec

    # Options
    #
    # These are any options you want to pass to the command. Use the long form.
    # The value should match the type of the option.
    options:
      quiet: true
      primary: true
      role: web

    # Arguments
    #
    # If we want to pass arguments to the command, we do that here.
    # Any arguments passed via the command line will be appended to these
